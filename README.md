All the projects are in Swift language unless specified or mentioned. This repository will contain all the iOS applications that I am currently working on under my Udemy course with Devslopes.

Miracle Pill :- Created a basic universal iOS application which shows the basic functionality of autolayout, button, picker view, label, text box and image view. Added a feature in which keyboard will disappear when a user touches on screen and alert will show up when all/one of the text fields are kept empty. But there is one problem if the screen size is 4.7 inch then whole screen will not display. When "Buy Now" button is clicked the whole view will be hidden and an image view which mentions successful will be displayed.

Page The Scroll :- This application shows the functionality of using scroll view in an application. 

Stackatada-Stack:- This appication shows the functionality of using stack view in an application. In the application only static view was used and no actions are perfomed in that application.

Swapping Screen:- This application shows the functionality of using segues programtically and through dragging from one screenn to another screen. In programtically we need to pass the correct identifier name due to that application will not crash. Added a feature in which keyboard will disappear when a user touches on screen or on retrun key in keyboard and alert will show up when all/one of the text fields are kept empty.

Retro Calculator:- This is a basic calculator application in which stack view and auto layout constraints both were used. Launch screen feature was used in this application which shows up for around one second when the application is launched. Added a clear button later on so we can erase the result and start a new calculation. When you click on equal button, the clear button get visible and as soon as clear button is pressed or clicked it will be hidden again and on that place zero button will be visible.

Party Rock App:- This applications shows the basic functionality of using table view and web view. The static videos url, title and images are used and it is displayed in next screen in a web view. As soon as we click on the table cell it will perform a segue to another screen which shows the particular video being played on web view. As it is basic app the html, css and javascript are not used so the video displayed will not be as per the screen resolution.

Rainy Shiny Cloudy App:- A simple weather application that fetches current location weather coordinates by using third party libraries and API. In this app cocoa pods were used to install the Alamofire libraries which is swift HTTP networking libraries to display the data from th Open Weather API. The data was JSON parsed and core location libraries were used to display the current location weather information. 

Beacon Demo App:- A simple beacon application that shows how far is the beacon from device using core location. As soon as the device is nearby the beacon, the beacon will start boradcasting the UUID, major and minor number. The result will show how far is the beacon from device and boradcast the major and minor number with rssi value.
