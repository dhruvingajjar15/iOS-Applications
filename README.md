All the projects are in Swift language unless specified or mentioned.

Miracle Pill :- Created a basic universal iOS application which shows the basic functionality of autolayout, button, picker view, label, text box and image view. Added a feature in which keyboard will disappear when a user touches on screen and alert will show up when all/one of the text fields are kept empty. But there is one problem if the screen size is 4.7 inch then whole screen will not display. When "Buy Now" button is clicked the whole view will be hidden and an image view which mentions successful will be displayed.

Page The Scroll :- This application shows the functionality of using scroll view in an application.

In programtically we need to pass the correct identifier name due to that application will not crash. Added a feature in which keyboard will disappear when a user touches on screen or on retrun key in keyboard and alert will show up when all/one of the text fields are kept empty.

Retro Calculator:- This is a basic calculator application in which stack view and auto layout constraints both were used. Launch screen feature was used in this application which shows up for around one second when the application is launched. Added a clear button later on so we can erase the result and start a new calculation. When you click on equal button, the clear button get visible and as soon as clear button is pressed or clicked it will be hidden again and on that place zero button will be visible.
