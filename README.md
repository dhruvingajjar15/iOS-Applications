Created a basic universal iOS application which shows the basic functionality of autolayout, button, picker view, label, text box and image view. Added a feature in which keyboard will disappear when a user touches on screen. But there is one problem if the screen size is 4.7 inch then whole screen will not display. When "Buy Now" button is clicked the whole view will be hidden and an image view which mentions successful will be displayed.
