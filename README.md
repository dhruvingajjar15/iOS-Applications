All the projects are in Swift language unless specified or mentioned.
Miracle Pill :- Created a basic universal iOS application which shows the basic functionality of autolayout, button, picker view, label, text box and image view. Added a feature in which keyboard will disappear when a user touches on screen and alert will show up when all/one of the text fields are kept empty. But there is one problem if the screen size is 4.7 inch then whole screen will not display. When "Buy Now" button is clicked the whole view will be hidden and an image view which mentions successful will be displayed.
Page The Scroll :- This application shows the functionality of using scroll view in an application.
